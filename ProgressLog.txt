Notes:
- There are some arduino libraries compatable with NFC reader: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/stm32duino-x-nucleo-nfc04a1/
- useful for the future: https://store.particle.io/ : allows programming of the externam device completely remotely (no need to plug into microcontroller to reprogram it)
- ESP32 highly suggested (edgerton Jonathan) to get started with bc it has buit in WiFi + Bluetooth capabilities
- Instructable for programming Nucleo with Arduino IDE: https://www.instructables.com/Quick-Start-to-STM-Nucleo-on-Arduino-IDE/
- successful blinky LED!!! https://microdigisoft.com/getting-started-stm32cube-programmer-blink-led/

Notes:
- Can use Nucleo-64 (L476RG) with Arduino Uno Rev3 (supposedly): question remains: can we use NFC with Arduino instead of with Nucleo
- Can use Nucleo-32 with Arduino Nano (question remains as above)
- Exists a configuration code setup in order to get the Nucleo board to only use muA of current
- Can get MCU to draw .1 - 5 muA in "stop2" mode: https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus-products/nucleo-stm32l412rb-p-how-to-measure-idd-only-through-stm32/td-p/142433
- More details about which pins can be disabled for low-power modes: https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/rm0351-stm32l47xxx-stm32l48xxx-stm32l49xxx-and-stm32l4axxx-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf
- Code examples for low-power modes! https://forum.digikey.com/t/low-power-modes-on-the-stm32l0-series/13306

ACTION PLAN: 
- Try different low power modes to see if power can still be transferred to the NFC bc if this is the case, then take new Nucleo board with no previous solders (caps to GND, etc.) and program MCU into stop2 (or whichever low power mode) -> ensure that none of the caps/res remain necessary -> make breakout board with only the truly necessary connections
- Measure current consumption of these low power modes (single digit micro amps or ~50 muA is acceptable: translates to 10-12 days of charging)
- probe all minimum assembly pins to check signal + manipulate signal to test impact on output

- familiar with ST microprocessor families
- determined current task
- Useful YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfBeq-Fu0hc
- smaller half of the Nucleo is a built-in programmer (instead of needing to use a STM32CubeProgrammer)
- Could use BluePill ST board instead of the Nucleo (is smaller + has less functionality - only has the procressor on it)
- Identify minimum system config for the NFC

Notes:
STM32F = mainstream microcontroller
STM32L = Low Power (power efficient)
STM32H = High performance

Dev Boards:
Nucleo(-32, -64, -144) = corresponds to #pins on the baord
BluePill = STM32F103C8T6
- has arduino support (aka use Arduino IDE to program)
- has only microcontroller on it, no extra bells/whistles

ST32 Programming workflow: 
1. STM32CubeMX = set initial config for registers
2. STM32CubeIDE
3. get code from IDE -> Microcontroller
