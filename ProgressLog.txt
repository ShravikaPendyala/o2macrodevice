- familiar with ST microprocessor families
- determined current task
- Useful YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfBeq-Fu0hc
- smaller half of the Nucleo is a built-in programmer (instead of needing to use a STM32CubeProgrammer)
- Could use BluePill ST board instead of the Nucleo (is smaller + has less functionality - only has the procressor on it)
- Identify minimum system config for the NFC

Notes:
STM32F = mainstream microcontroller
STM32L = Low Power (power efficient)
STM32H = High performance

Dev Boards:
Nucleo(-32, -64, -144) = corresponds to #pins on the baord
BluePill = STM32F103C8T6
- has arduino support (aka use Arduino IDE to program)
- has only microcontroller on it, no extra bells/whistles

ST32 Programming workflow: 
1. STM32CubeMX = set initial config for registers
2. STM32CubeIDE
3. get code from IDE -> Microcontroller
