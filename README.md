Right now, the only code used to upload to the ST Nucleo is main.c located in 
(NUCLEO-L476RG/Applications/NFC08A1_PollingTagDetectNDEF/Src/main.c)

The NFC06A1 is not used anywhere

Task: 
Determine what aspects of the Nucleo-L476RG are actually necessary to just power the NFC08A1 board + start thinking about designing a board that does the minimum required to power the NFC board.
